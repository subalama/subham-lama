                 Well my name is Subham Lama and I was born in Darjeeling.
                 I've completed my schooling from Little Angels' High School situated in Lalitpur,Nepal.
                 I am a graduate in Bachelors of Commerce(Hons) from a prestigious and autonomous institution,
                 St Xavier's College,Kolkata.My major hobbies are related to music and I love to play guitar and sing.
                 I'm a self taught web developer and I enjoy creating websites a lot.
                 Everyday is like a learning day for me and I believe gaining more knowledge and skills is my virtue.
